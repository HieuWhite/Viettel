A phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform named 'Lucid' has been targeting 169 entities in 88 countries using well-crafted messages sent on iMessage (iOS) and RCS (Android).

Lucid, which has been operated by Chinese cybercriminals known as the 'XinXin group' since mid-2023, is sold to other threat actors via a subscription-based model that gives them access to over 1,000 phishing domains, tailored auto-generated phishing sites, and pro-grade spamming tools. 

Prodaft researchers note that XinXin has also been using the Darcula v3 platform for its operations, which indicates a potential connection between the two PhaaS platforms.

Subscriptions to Lucid are sold via a dedicated Telegram channel (2,000 members), and customers are granted access via licenses on a weekly basis.

Massive phishing operation
The threat group claims to send 100,000 smishing messages daily via Rich Communication Services (RCS) or Apple iMessage, which are end-to-end encrypted, allowing them to evade spam filters.

"The platform employs an automated attack delivery mechanism, deploying customizable phishing websites distributed primarily through SMS-based lures," explains Prodaft.

"To enhance effectiveness, Lucid leverages Apple iMessage and Android's RCS technology, bypassing traditional SMS spam filters and significantly increasing delivery and success rates."

Apart from evasion, the use of these messages also makes the operation cost-effective, as sending SMS on comparable volumes can have significant costs.

Lucid operators use large-scale iOS and Android device farms to send text messages. For iMessage, Lucid uses temporary Apple IDs. For RCS, the threat actors exploit carrier-specific implementation flaws in sender validation.
